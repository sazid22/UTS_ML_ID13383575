        "In the paper \"Generative Adversarial Network\", the authors has proposed a new model that has opened new possibilities in the research of generative modelling. Generative models has been a popular research topic in the field of machine laerning, but this is the first publication on generative models using adversarial process. In this paper, the authors framework of training two models simultaneously. Where generative models attempt to cerate new real data points from a latent space whereas the other model which is the discriminative model tries to determine if the received data is from the traning dataset or it has been generated by the Generator model.
