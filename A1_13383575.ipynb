        "In the paper \"Generative Adversarial Network\", the authors have proposed a new model that has opened new possibilities in the research of generative modeling. Discriminative models have been a popular research topic in the field of machine learning, but this is the leading publication on generative models using the adversarial process. What a generative model does is they create new data points from given training data points. Previously it was done by mapping from X to Y where X is the training data space and Y is the corresponding data points in the generated data space. This paper provides a new way of generating this fake dataspace. Rather than doing mapping, the authors provide a framework consisting of a generative model and a discriminative model. The generator creates datapoint given any distribution and discriminator identifies if the data is from a real distribution or it has been fakely generated. This is where the term \"adversarial\" comes handy, as discriminator identifies between the fake and real, the generator produces better output through the process by learning on the basis of the outcome of the discriminator. The goal of this generative model is as such that the discriminator predicts as low as possible approximately half of the fake points and the real point.  \n",

        "As mentioned earlier, the generative model has been a field of interest for machine learning pioneer, there has been some issue. This is mostly with the probability approximation where it might require to use less accurate maximum likelihood estimation or models like Markov chains is used to calculate the probability. This makes the approximation very complex as well as inaccurate. Ian Goodfellow and his team stepsides these difficulties and propose a new process for the estimation calculation of the generative model. "

        "In this paper, the authors provide a framework of training two models - Generative model and Discriminative model simultaneously. Where generative models attempt to create new real data points from a latent space whereas the other model which is the Discriminative model tries to determine if the received data is from the training dataset or it has been generated by the Generator model. As these two models compete with each other, the generative model tries to fool the discriminator so that the generated data points cannot be distinguished by the discriminative model. "
