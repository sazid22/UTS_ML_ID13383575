        "In the paper \"Generative Adversarial Network\", the authors has proposed a new model that has opened new possibilities in the research of generative modelling. Discriminative models has been a popular research topic in the field of machine learning, but this is the leading publication on generative models using adversarial process. In this paper, the authors provide a framework of training two models - Generative model and Discriminative model simultaneously. Where generative models attempt to create new real data points from a latent space whereas the other model which is the Discriminative model tries to determine if the received data is from the training dataset or it has been generated by the Generator model. As these two models competes with each other, the generative model tries to fool the discriminator so that the generated data points cannot be distinguished by the discriminative model. \n",

        "As mentioned earlier, generative model has been a field of interest for machine learning pioneer, there has been some issue. This is mostly with the probability approximation where it might require to use less accurate maximum likelihood estimation or models like markov chains is used to calculate the "
